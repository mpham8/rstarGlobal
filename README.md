# rstarGlobal-18countries

“The Fall 2025 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity *["Discussion of 'What next for r*' by Lukasz Rachel"]() by Marco Del Negro extends the Global r* model in *[Global Trends in Interest Rates](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2019.01.010)* by Marco Del Negro, Domenico Giannone, Marc Giannoni, and Andrea Tambalotti to 18 countries.

## Required software

These scripts were produced using MATLAB R2020a.

## Replicating figures and tables

[*“The Fall 2025 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity: Discussion of ‘What next for r*?’ by Łukasz Rachel,” discussed by Marco Del Negro*]() uses Model 1, which estimates the baseline model with prior to variance of innovation to the trend component equal to 1, and Model 2, which estimates the model with a convenience yield. The mentioned figures are referenced to in this codebase as 'Figure 1' and 'Figure 3b'.

- load updated data into data file: `indata/DataInflShortLongUpdated.xlsx`
- run Model 1
	- run the Matlab script: `scripts/MainModel.m`
	- model outputs outputted to `results/18/OutputModel1.mat`
- run Model 2
	- run the Matlab script: `scripts/MainModel2.m`
	- model outputs outputted to `results/18/OutputModel2.mat`
- create figures
	- to recreate figures from this discussion: in `scripts/MainModel1_MakeFigures.m`, run the 'Plot preliminaries' block, then 'Figure 1' block, then 'Figure 3b' block
- create table
	- to recreate the table from this discussion: in `scripts/makeTables.m`, run the 'Table A1a: Change in r-bar^w_t and Its Components (baseline), additional details' block to get the baseline change, then run the 'Table A1b: Change in r-bar^w_t and Its Components (Convenience Yield), additional details' block to get the change under the convenience yield model, then .tex tables are outputted to `tables/`

## Data sources

The [`indata`](indata/) folder contains the underlying data. Data on short-term rates, long-term rates, and consumer prices come from the Jordà-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database. Data for Moody's Baa corporate bond yield are available from FRED. Demographic data come from the United States Census Bureau and from the UN World Population Statistics database. Data on corporate spreads come from Gilchrist and Mojon (2018). Please see *[Global Trends in Interest Rates](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinteco.2019.01.010)* by Marco Del Negro, Domenico Giannone, Marc Giannoni, and Andrea Tambalotti for additional details on the data sources.
